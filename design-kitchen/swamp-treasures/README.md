Design exploration for the Swamp Treasures section pages.

## 📁 Learnings Page Options

Three layout approaches to choose from:

| File | Style | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| `learnings-optionA-timeline.html` | Timeline / Journal | Story-driven, "come on my journey" |
| `learnings-optionB-cards.html` | Card Grid | Quick reference, browsable insights |
| `learnings-optionC-mixed.html` | Cards + Timeline | Both! Quick glance + full stories |

---

## 👀 How to Preview

Open in browser via the design-kitchen server:

```
http://localhost:8888/swamp-treasures/learnings-optionA-timeline.html
http://localhost:8888/swamp-treasures/learnings-optionB-cards.html
http://localhost:8888/swamp-treasures/learnings-optionC-mixed.html
```

Or just double-click the HTML files.

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Option C (Mixed)** is recommended because:
1. Quick visitors can scan the insight cards at top
2. Curious visitors can scroll to read full stories
3. Matches the multi-box structure of the home page
4. Scales well as more learnings are added

# Content Style Guide

Preferences for writing content on MossyRealm. Reference this when generating blogs, updates, or any user-facing text.

## Do Not Use

- Em dashes (—). Use periods, colons, or parentheses instead.
- Tildes (~) at the end of sentences.
- AI-sounding language. No "dive into", "leverage", "robust", "seamless", "elevate", "empower", "utilize".
- Overly enthusiastic language. No "amazing!", "incredible!", "game-changer!".
- Preachy tone. State observations, don't lecture.
- Stating the obvious. If something is common knowledge, skip it.

## Voice

- First person, casual.
- Direct. Say what happened, not what "was experienced".
- Can be funny but not forced. Reddit/Insta comment energy is fine.
- Personal anecdotes welcome. Include context (high school, undergrad, work, etc).
- Okay to be self-deprecating about past struggles.

## Structure

- Short paragraphs. 2-3 sentences max.
- Use sections with headers for longer posts.
- Blockquotes for memorable one-liners or lessons.
- Lists for technical details.
- Tags at the bottom of posts.

## Technical Content

- Explain decisions, not just steps.
- Include what didn't work and why.
- If something took forever, say so.
- No hand-holding. Assume reader knows basics.

## Updates Section

- Keep entries short. One sentence.
- No tildes, no exclamation marks.
- Just state what happened.

## Examples

Bad: "I leveraged Cloudflare's robust DNS infrastructure to seamlessly connect my domain!"

Good: "Switched nameservers to Cloudflare. Waited 20 minutes. Done."

Bad: "This journey has been incredible~"

Good: "This took way longer than expected."

Bad: "Don't forget to check your DNS propagation!"

Good: (just don't include it, everyone knows)

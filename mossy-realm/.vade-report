# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

## Summary
Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for this Next.js 16.0.10 project using App Router.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Installation
- **File**: `package.json`
- **Action**: Added `@vercel/speed-insights` version ^1.3.1 to dependencies
- Used npm to install the package, which also updated `package-lock.json`

### 2. Root Layout Integration
- **File**: `app/layout.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added import: `import { SpeedInsights } from "@vercel/speed-insights/next"`
  - Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the `<body>` tag, after all other content
  - Placed after the grain overlay component but before the closing body tag

## Implementation Details

Since this is a Next.js 16.0.10 project (well above 13.5+) using the App Router pattern:
- Used the `/next` import path as recommended for Next.js 13.5+
- Added the component to the root layout file (`app/layout.tsx`)
- No additional configuration or route props needed (handled automatically by the package)
- Component is positioned at the end of the body tag to avoid interfering with existing layout

## Verification

1. ✅ Build completed successfully with `npm run build`
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation passed
3. ✅ Static page generation worked correctly
4. ✅ No new linting errors introduced (existing linting errors in the codebase are unrelated to this change)
5. ✅ Lock files properly updated

## Files Modified
- `app/layout.tsx` - Added SpeedInsights component and import
- `package.json` - Added @vercel/speed-insights dependency
- `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency tree

The Speed Insights component will now automatically collect and report Web Vitals metrics when deployed to Vercel.
